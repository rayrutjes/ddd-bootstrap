# DDD Bootstrap.

DDD Bootstrap is a bunch of simple PHP implementations of some of the concepts behind Domain Driven Design. 

This is not a framework and never will be.

In a real project, if you intend to use parts of this package as a way to quickly start your DDD project, I would recommend you copy the parts you are interested in.

## Requirements.

We use PHP 7 by default. I think that DDD should be considered at the start of your project so going for PHP 7 shouldn't be a problem.

## Contributing.

Please feel free to contribute by any means.

This package is intended to be free of dependencies. If you want to introduce a dependency, please do so in another repository.
